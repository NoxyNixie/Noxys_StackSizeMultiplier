[mod-setting-description]
Noxys_StackSizeMultiplier-multiplier=The Multiplier. You can use decimal values below 1 to reduce the stack sizes (Actual stacks sizes will always be at least 1 item).
Noxys_StackSizeMultiplier-tweakbots=Tweak construction robots to have the same multiplier applied to their payload capacity.
Noxys_StackSizeMultiplier-tweaklogibots=Tweak logistics robots to have the same multiplier applied to their payload capacity.
Noxys_StackSizeMultiplier-ignoreonestacks=Prevent items that would otherwise have a stack size of one, such as satellites and buildings, from being multiplied. (Intended to prevent automatic launching of more than 1 satellite at a time).
